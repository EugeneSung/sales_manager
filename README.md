# SalesManager
This is a Sinatra Application that I created for my Sinatra Final Project at Learn//Flatiron School. You can use this app to manage your customers and item list for your small business. 


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'sales_manager'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install sales_manager

## Usage

After cloning the repo, run bundle install to install dependencies. To migrate your local database, run rake db:migrate. To start the application on your machine, run shotgun. In a browser, go to http://localhost:9393/ to begin (Note: you may be using a different port. Please update accordingly).

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
