#SalesManager
This is a Sinatra Application that I created for my Sinatra Final Project at Learn//Flatiron School.
You can use this app to manage your customers and item list for your small business.

#Usage
After cloning the repo, run bundle install to install dependencies. To migrate your local database, run rake db:migrate. To start the application on your machine, run shotgun. In a browser, go to http://localhost:9393/ to begin (Note: you may be using a different port. Please update accordingly).

#Contributing
